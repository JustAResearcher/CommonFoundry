# ForgeMatrix v2 recommended research specification

Status: **design target, not an activated consensus algorithm**. The parameter
set below is the recommended 16 GiB research profile. It is not permission to
launch a public-value network.

ForgeMatrix v2 is intended to prove the committed matrix relation with a
transparent succinct argument. It proves neither that a particular GPU was
used nor that the model was physically resident in GPU VRAM.

## Fixed research profile

| Parameter | Value |
|---|---:|
| Batch, `B` | 128 |
| Dimension, `D` | 4096 |
| Layers, `L` | 384, organized as 3 banks of 128 |
| Weight encoding | one raw byte in `0..=250`, decoded as `byte - 125` |
| Activation encoding | one raw field representative in `0..=250`, decoded as `value - 125` |
| Transition modulus, `P` | 134,217,689 (prime) |
| Output alphabet modulus | 251 |
| Proof base field | Goldilocks, `p = 2^64 - 2^32 + 1` |
| Transcript challenge space | at least 192 bits; a degree-4 Goldilocks extension is recommended |

The 384 weight matrices contain exactly `384 * 4096 * 4096 =
6,442,450,944` raw bytes (6 GiB). The base input table contains another
`128 * 4096 = 524,288` bytes. Each matrix and the base table are row-major.
Bytes `251..=255` are invalid; generation samples bytes by rejection rather
than reducing an eight-bit value modulo 251.

The three weight banks contain layers `0..127`, `128..255`, and `256..383`.
The grouping gives each bank power-of-two multilinear dimensions and has no
rule that permits a bank or layer to be omitted.

## Model artifact and its two commitments

The model is a published raw artifact, not a 32-byte seed expanded by consensus
code. Its ordered payload is the base input table followed by `W_0` through
`W_383`. The canonical model-bank format and manifest fix the model version,
`B`, `D`, `L`, byte encoding, order and length of every table, byte roots, PCS
parameter digest, and PCS commitment root. The enclosing consensus descriptor
separately fixes the network, algorithm/proof versions, and bank layout.

The current canonical file header is exactly 184 bytes in this order:

```text
8 bytes   ASCII magic "CMFDBNK2"
u32 LE    format version = 2
u32 LE    header length = 184
u32 LE    model version
u32 LE    dimension D
u32 LE    batch B
u32 LE    layer count L
u64 LE    base-input byte length
u64 LE    bytes per layer
u64 LE    total payload bytes
32 bytes  raw payload BLAKE3 root
32 bytes  layer-roots aggregate
32 bytes  PCS parameter digest
32 bytes  PCS commitment root
```

The payload immediately follows: base table, then layers `0..L-1`, with no
trailing bytes. The raw root is ordinary BLAKE3 over that exact payload. For
each layer, `layer_root_i = BLAKE3(layer_i)`, and
`layer_roots_aggregate = BLAKE3-derive-key("CMFD/FORGEMATRIX/V2/LAYER-ROOTS",
u32_le(L) || each u32_le(i) || layer_root_i)`. The manifest digest is
BLAKE3 derive-key with `"CMFD/FORGEMATRIX/V2/MANIFEST"` over the complete
canonical 184-byte header.

The manifest carries two distinct bindings:

1. A BLAKE3 byte root identifies the exact raw payload used for distribution
   and reproducible auditing. A separate domain-separated manifest digest
   binds that root to the canonical header and all other manifest fields.
2. A transparent polynomial-commitment-scheme (PCS) commitment binds the field
   polynomials opened by the block proof.

A one-time, independently verifiable link certificate must prove that every PCS
entry is the field encoding of the corresponding byte under the BLAKE3 root,
including the rejection of `251..=255`. Alternatively, every full node may
stream the complete artifact and deterministically recompute both bindings at
model activation; that expensive check must produce the same manifest hash.
A BLAKE3 root by itself is not a PCS commitment, and merely placing both values
in one manifest does not prove that they describe the same data.

The recommended PCS layout is one multilinear commitment for the base table,
indexed by 7 row bits and 12 column bits, and one commitment for each 128-layer
weight bank, indexed by 7 layer bits, 12 common-dimension bits, and 12 output-
column bits. The scheme must be transparent: no participant-generated trusted
setup or hidden toxic waste is allowed.

MLE point vectors use the least-significant, fastest-changing row-major axis
first. The base table uses `[column, row]`; a weight bank uses
`[column, common, layer]`; activation and witness banks use
`[column, row, layer]`. The final PCS suite must canonically encode and order
the base commitment followed by banks 0, 1, and 2, then domain-hash those four
encodings into `pcs_commitment_root`. The concrete suite ID and wire encoding
remain to be selected and frozen.

No short public generation seed may be included in the activated manifest.
This removes the specific consensus-sanctioned shortcut of regenerating each
layer from a tiny seed. It does not prove that the published bytes are
information-theoretically incompressible, so the generation ceremony, entropy
sources, resulting artifact, and structural analyses still require public
review.

## Block challenge and affine masks

The domain-separated v2 challenge binds, in canonical byte encoding, at least:

- chain identifier and proof-protocol identifier;
- algorithm version, model version, manifest hash, byte root, and PCS
  commitments;
- previous block hash and transaction Merkle root;
- height, timestamp, the chain-derived difficulty target, and nonce.

For the virtual input layer and every real layer `l` in `0..383`, derive one
constant coefficient, seven row-bit coefficients, and twelve column-bit
coefficients from a domain-separated BLAKE3 XOF keyed by the complete block
challenge and a canonical `u32` layer tag. The virtual layer tag is
`0xffffffff`; real layer tags are `0..383`. Consume the XOF byte stream in
order, accept candidates in `0..=250`, and reject `251..=255`. No `% 251`
reduction is permitted during coefficient sampling.

Writing `r_i` and `c_j` for the little-endian Boolean index bits, define the
ordinary integer mask

```text
M(l,r,c) = a_l + sum(i=0..6, br_l[i] * r_i)
               + sum(j=0..11, bc_l[j] * c_j)
```

Do not reduce `M` before adding it to the accumulator. It lies in `0..=5000`.
The same affine expression evaluates its multilinear extension at a verifier's
random row/column point, avoiding a committed per-cell mask table or a hash
inside every transition constraint. Coefficient derivation is outside the
large matrix circuit, but its transcript inputs and rejection-sampling rules
are consensus data and must be checked by the verifier.

## Base input and layer relation

The committed base table is not used directly. Treat it as a virtual layer:
decode its entry to `s = base_raw[r,c] - 125`, apply the virtual-layer affine
mask, and apply the same mod-251 cubic permutation below. Its output is
`X_0[r,c]`.

For each real layer, decode `W_l[k,c] = weight_raw - 125` and compute

```text
s_l[r,c] = sum(k = 0..4095) X_l[r,k] * W_l[k,c]
```

This is an exact signed-integer dot product. Floating point, TF32, stochastic
rounding, saturation, and wraparound are not part of the relation.

For either the virtual layer or a real layer, first encode the signed `z` into
the prime transition field `P = 134,217,689`, then apply its cubic permutation
and reduce only the final field representative to the byte alphabet:

```text
z = s + M(l,r,c)
e = z                     when z >= 0
e = P + z                 when z < 0
e^2   = P*q2 + r2         with 0 <= e,r2 < P
r2*e  = P*q3 + h          with 0 <= h < P
h     = 251*t + v         with 0 <= v <= 250
next_raw = v
next_signed = v - 125
```

For a real layer, `next_signed` is `X_(l+1)[r,c]`; for virtual layer `-1`, it
is `X_0[r,c]`. `P` is prime and `P mod 3 = 2`, so `gcd(3, P-1) = 1` and cubing
is a permutation of the transition field. Reducing the dot product directly
modulo 251 is not equivalent to this function.

### Exact integer bounds

With `D = 4096` and both operands in `[-125,125]`, every real-layer dot product
obeys

```text
-64,000,000 <= s <= 64,000,000
-64,000,000 <= z <= 64,005,000
0 <= e,r2,h < 134,217,689
0 <= q2,q3 <= 134,217,687
0 <= t <= 534,731
0 <= v <= 250
-125 <= next_signed <= 125
```

For the virtual layer, `s` is in `[-125,125]`, `z` is in `[-125,5125]`, and
the same canonical transition-field encoding applies.

Every dot product and `z` fits in signed 32 bits. The two modular-multiplication
products fit in unsigned 64 bits and are smaller than the Goldilocks proof
field. The proof must establish the exact signed dot-product value and its
range, but consensus cannot mandate an instruction sequence or accumulator
type; a wider or mathematically equivalent implementation is valid. The full
allowed `z` interval has width 128,005,000, strictly less than `P`, so its
canonical residue uniquely identifies the exact integer. This is the defense
against the earlier search shortcut that discarded high accumulator bits by
reducing directly modulo 251.

## Succinct proof shape

The recommended proof is a non-zero-knowledge GKR/sumcheck argument backed by a
transparent multilinear PCS. Zero knowledge adds cost but no consensus benefit
for this public computation.

- Commit to the permanent base table and three weight-bank multilinear
  extensions described above.
- For a winning nonce, commit to activation and witness oracles for `X`, `S`,
  `E`, `Q2`, `R2`, `Q3`, `H`, `T`, and `V`, plus their range bits, split into
  the same three 128-layer segments. A segment is indexed by 7 layer bits, 7
  row bits, and 12 column bits.
- Prove each matrix product with the claim
  `S_l(r,c) = sum_k X_l(r,k) * W_l(k,c)`. The reduction over the 12 `k` bits is a
  degree-2 sumcheck. GKR batching must bind all 384 layers and both segment
  boundaries, not a sampled subset chosen before the transcript.
- Prove pointwise the signed-to-`P` encoding, both modular multiplication
  reductions, `h = 251*t + v`, and `X_(l+1) = v - 125`, including the virtual
  input layer. Range/lookup arguments must enforce the exact bounds above. In
  particular, field congruence without range proofs is insufficient.
- Batch the final PCS openings only after all commitments and claims have been
  absorbed into the Fiat-Shamir transcript. Canonically reject malformed field
  encodings, duplicate transcript forms, trailing data, replay under another
  block or model, and proof malleability.

Goldilocks is the base arithmetic field, but a single base-field challenge is
not the security target. Transcript challenges and random batching coefficients
must come from an extension or independent compound challenge space of at least
192 bits. A degree-4 Goldilocks extension is the conservative default because
`p^3` is slightly smaller than `2^192`. The complete parameter set must show at
least 128 bits of overall soundness after the union bound across sumchecks, PCS
openings, range arguments, and Fiat-Shamir reductions.

A sampled row check or plain Freivalds check is not a substitute for this
proof. Proof generation should occur only after the miner has computed a nonce
whose work digest meets the target; requiring a full succinct proof for every
losing nonce would make the proof system, rather than the matrix work, the
mining bottleneck.

## Final-activation BLAKE3 gap

The proposed mining digest retains a cheap pre-proof target test:

```text
final_activation_digest =
    BLAKE3-derive-key("CMFD/FORGEMATRIX/OUTPUT/V2",
                      challenge || u64_le(length) || canonical final_raw)

work_digest =
    BLAKE3-derive-key("CMFD/FORGEMATRIX/WORK/V2",
                      challenge || model_byte_root || model_PCS_root ||
                      final_activation_digest)
```

`canonical final_raw` is the row-major `B * D` table of `v` representatives,
each encoded as one byte in `0..=250`. `work_digest` is compared as an unsigned
256-bit big-endian integer with the chain-derived target.

The succinct verifier cannot safely accept `final_activation_digest` as an
unproved miner claim. Production must do one of the following:

1. arithmetize BLAKE3 and prove that the final activation bytes hash to the
   digest;
2. give the verifier all 524,288 final bytes to hash, which adds 512 KiB to
   every block and violates the preferred total proof-plus-public-witness
   payload gate; or
3. adopt a reviewed proof-native final digest in a later algorithm revision and
   define the target calculation around it.

The repository does not yet close this gap. A proof of the matrix and cubic
relations that leaves the final BLAKE3 digest unbound is not a valid block
proof.

## What the proof cannot establish

The argument proves evaluation of the committed function. Software consensus
cannot prove that the raw bytes physically resided in GPU VRAM, that a GPU was
used, or that a particular instruction sequence executed. A conforming miner
may stream the artifact from host memory or use a CPU, FPGA, ASIC, or a more
efficient equivalent algorithm.

The intended defense is economic: the unverified design hypothesis is that the
6 GiB bank and repeated dense access make resident GPU execution the fast path
on a 16 GiB card. Hardware
attestation could be offered outside consensus, but it would add vendor trust,
exclude much consumer hardware, and still would not replace the arithmetic
proof.

No VRAM minimum exists in consensus. An 8 GiB device may retain the raw mining
bank while staging proof data elsewhere; 2--6 GiB devices may tile or stream
from host RAM or storage. All remain valid if they compute the exact relation.
Complete winning-proof memory and speed are unmeasured, and mining eligibility
is separate from whether a card can host a particular paid inference model.

Activation therefore requires a reproducible comparison using identical nonce
vectors: fully resident, double-buffered pinned-host streaming, pageable-host
streaming, on-the-fly lossless regeneration/decompression of the exact v2
artifact if any is discovered, and the best compressed/decode path. Treat v1
seed regeneration only as a separate historical negative control because it
cannot reproduce the seedless v2 bank. Test both enforced 2, 4, 6, and 8 GiB
caps and representative physical cards. Pin PCIe generation/link width, CPU,
host-RAM topology and speed, storage, driver, clocks, and power limits. After a
30-second warmup, run at least five randomized 120-second trials. Record median
and p95 nonce time, setup time, host-to-device bytes, peak VRAM, host RSS,
power, and energy. The resident path must be at least four times faster than
the best valid <=4 GiB or nonresident path on every named baseline card, or the
profile must change.

## Activation and benchmark gates

Mainnet remains disabled until all of these gates have reproducible evidence:

- a complete proof implementation for all 384 layers, range constraints, model
  link, final-activation digest, block challenge, nonce, and target;
- peak device allocation no greater than 13.5 GiB on supported 16 GiB cards,
  measured end to end rather than inferred from model size;
- winning-nonce proof generation below 10 seconds, with a target below 5
  seconds, without changing the proved relation;
- proof size at most 256 KiB, with 64 KiB as the stretch target, and an explicit
  separate cap for total proof plus public witness bytes;
- proof verification below 100 ms on a specified ordinary CPU core;
- at least 128 bits of documented total soundness with at least 192-bit
  transcript challenges;
- two independent prover/verifier implementations with byte-for-byte canonical
  vectors and CPU/GPU arithmetic differential tests;
- adversarial tests for skipped layers or output, seed/regeneration shortcuts,
  sparse or malformed model data, false byte-root/PCS links, invalid ranges,
  transcript substitution, replay, malleability, target confusion, and
  arithmetic divergence;
- audits by at least two independent teams and a public, incentivized testnet.

## Repository implementation status

`cmfd-consensus` retains the ForgeMatrix v1 full-recomputation oracle only for
comparison. The v2 research code now implements:

- a seedless model-bank format, bounded fixture builder, and 64 KiB-buffered
  verifier for canonical lengths, bytes in `0..=250`, BLAKE3 roots, and
  manifest-selected PCS identity fields;
- a tiny-profile exact integer witness generator/checker for initialization,
  every GEMM, affine masks, signed transition-field encoding, two modular
  multiplication reductions, output reduction, centered activation encoding,
  final digest, and block target;
- a standalone Fiat--Shamir matrix-multiplication sumcheck skeleton with
  canonical Goldilocks field representatives in transcript hashing,
  commitment/transcript mutation tests, and a hard 4096-element research cap;
- Rust and CUDA v2 arithmetic smoke vectors that compare initialization and
  every layer after applying fixture-supplied mask coefficients.

The PCS fields remain opaque manifest values. The toy sumcheck verifier still
receives the full matrices to recompute multilinear openings, uses only the
64-bit base field, has no canonical bounded proof wire decoder, is not wired to
the v2 witness/model/block verifier, and is neither succinct nor
production-sound. The production-sized v2 constructor is hard-disabled.

The repository does not yet implement the transparent PCS and byte-link
certificate, batched all-layer GKR, transition/range sumchecks, >=192-bit
extension-field transcript, or in-proof final BLAKE3 binding. The CUDA fixture
is a differential harness, not a tensor-core miner, succinct prover, low-VRAM
benchmark, or evidence of residency.
The CUDA oracle does not independently rederive the BLAKE3 mask coefficients;
an independent challenge-to-coefficient implementation and a broader vector
corpus remain required.

Implementing any subset of those components must not make the v2 profile
activatable. Activation is a separate consensus change after every gate above
is satisfied.
