# Common Foundry standalone CUDA miner

`cmfd-miner` is a separate command-line miner for dedicated NVIDIA mining
rigs. Normal `mine` mode is a thin client: it asks a configured Devnet node for
a complete mining template, searches the immutable proof-of-work challenge,
and returns the finished block to that node. It does not download the chain or
maintain a second node database. One independent CUDA worker runs on every
selected GPU.

## Supported GPUs

The packaged CUDA 12.9 fat library contains these native images:

| Architecture | CUDA target | Representative cards |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Volta | `sm_70` | Tesla V100, Titan V, Quadro GV100 |
| Turing | `sm_75` | GeForce RTX 20 series |
| Ampere | `sm_86` | GeForce RTX 30 series |
| Ada | `sm_89` | GeForce RTX 40 series |
| Blackwell | `sm_120` | GeForce RTX 50 series |

A `compute_70` PTX image is included for forward compatibility. CUDA Toolkit
12.9 is intentional: it can compile both Volta and Blackwell, whereas CUDA 13
removed offline compilation support for Volta. The miner package uses the
static CUDA runtime, so testers need a compatible NVIDIA driver but do not need
to install the CUDA Toolkit.

## Multi-GPU behavior

- With no `--device` options, every detected GPU with compute capability 7.0
  or newer is selected.
- Repeat `--device` to choose a subset, for example `--device 0 --device 2`.
- Every GPU owns a separate CUDA context, model allocation, and worker thread.
- GPU `i` begins at batch `i`; later batches advance by `GPU count × batch
  size`. This keeps nonce ranges disjoint across the rig.
- The displayed rig rate is the sum of complete ForgeMatrix nonce evaluations
  from every worker.
- Every statistics report includes rig and per-GPU hashrate, NVIDIA-reported
  power draw, hashes per watt, temperature, fan, utilization, graphics and
  memory clocks, and VRAM use. Session uptime, attempted nonces, accepted
  blocks, and stale-job rebuilds are also shown.
- One displayed `H/s` is one complete ForgeMatrix nonce evaluation per second.
  It is not an INT8 operation count.
- NVIDIA sensors are read through `nvidia-smi`, which ships with the driver.
  Unsupported sensors display `N/A`; telemetry failure never stops mining.
  Hashes per watt divides the interval hashrate by the instantaneous power
  sample taken for that report.
- CUDA is a candidate generator. Rust independently recomputes a below-target
  candidate before it can be submitted as a block.

## Windows quick start

The Windows ZIP includes:

- `cmfd-miner.exe`
- `cmfd-forgematrix-v2-miner.dll`
- `LIST-GPUS.bat`
- `START-MINER.bat`

Run `LIST-GPUS.bat`, then launch `START-MINER.bat`. Its defaults try a GUI
wallet on the same computer first and the community bootstrap second, so the
peer settings normally need no editing. Leave `GPU_INDEXES` blank to use every
supported card automatically. Copy the 64-character address from the wallet's
**Receive** page into `PAYOUT_ADDRESS` before starting. The connected node owns
the chain and creates each payout-bound template.

## Direct commands

List devices:

```text
cmfd-miner devices
```

Mine with every supported GPU and the community bootstrap:

```text
cmfd-miner mine --miner <64-character-wallet-receive-address> --peer 127.0.0.1:18444 --peer 107.214.187.2:18444 --allow-public-peers
```

Select GPUs 0, 1, and 3:

```text
cmfd-miner mine --miner <64-character-wallet-receive-address> --peer 127.0.0.1:18444 --device 0 --device 1 --device 3
```

Change the live-statistics interval from its five-second default:

```text
cmfd-miner mine --miner <64-character-wallet-receive-address> --peer 127.0.0.1:18444 --stats-seconds 10
```

The standalone miner currently performs continuous solo mining. The node
selects the parent, transactions, timestamp, target, and coinbase outputs. The
miner changes only the proof nonce, fully verifies a CUDA candidate in Rust,
and submits the complete canonical block. It prints `BLOCK ACCEPTED` only after
at least one configured node answers `Accepted` or `AlreadyKnown`.

The miner checks its source node every two seconds. A changed parent cancels
the current GPU job and fetches fresh work. A temporary disconnect pauses GPU
work and retries the preferred node followed by the configured failover nodes.
If all nodes disconnect after a block is found, the miner retains and retries
that exact block until a node accepts or rejects it.

`--miner` (or `PAYOUT_ADDRESS` in the packaged launch file) selects the coinbase
payout destination. It does not identify or locate a node. `--peer` selects the
node that receives blocks. One outbound miner-to-node peer configuration is
enough; the wallet/node does not also need to list the miner as a peer.

For diagnostics, `cmfd-miner full-node` preserves the former embedded-node
mode with its own data directory and P2P listener. Normal rig operation should
use `cmfd-miner mine` or the packaged launcher.
